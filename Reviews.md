# 2015-07-05: Chapter 1, Introduction
Well explained. Starting right off with the examples, which is a good thing.
The exercises are all manageable and on the right level. You already get to define your own functions, with the examples as help.
I made the 17.hs file for this chapter.

# 2015-07-06: Chapter 2, First steps
In this chapter you learn how to use the Hugs compiler. A quick but detailed explanation of the basic rules like function application.
Some library functions are introduced. You start to see the possibilities. I write a Haskell script, based on the book, named 24.hs.
The exercises are on the right level. You define your own programs with the help of the library functions.

# 2015-07-06: Chapter 3, Types and Classes
This chapter is a bit heavier, and I had to read some things twice. It goes through Types and curried functions and Classes.
The Class concept is a bit hard to grasp. There were lots of new words and terminologies so it was hard for me to understand the text.
I got some things explained by my dad.
These exercises were harder.

# 2015-07-07: Chapter 4, Defining functions
I found this chapter really fun and interesting. It's hard to understand the lambda concept, it was not explained enough.
The exercises were hard but on a good level. After working through them you understand the chapter much better.

#2015-07-08 to 2015-07-23: Chapter 5, List comprehensions
This chapter started on a high level, introducing the generator concept. It was hard for me to understand.
After working through all of the exercises, things got clearer.

#2015-07-18 to 2015-08-03: Chapter 6, Recursive functions
Before reading this book, I had tried some programming in Haskell with recursive functions - check out [my repository haskellbeginner](https://github.com/juliajansson/haskellbeginner) if you are interested - so it was easy to understand. I think recursive functions are fun and a nice recursive definition is beautiful. Good examples. 

#2015-08-03 to 2015-08-14: Chapter 7, Higher order functions
I liked this chapter from the beginning. After moving through sections 7.1 and 7.2 I did two exercises. I start to feel like I've improved a lot.
