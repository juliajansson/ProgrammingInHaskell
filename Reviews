Chapter 1, Introduction
Well explained. Starting right off with the examples, which is a good thing.
The exercises are all managable and on the right level. You already get to define your own functions, with the examples as help.
I made the 17.hs file for this chapter.

Chapter 2, First steps
In this chapter you learn how to use the Hugs compiler. A quick but detailed explanation of the basic rules like function application. 
Some library functions are introduced. You start to see the possibilities. I write a Haskell script, based on the book, named 24.hs.
The exercises are on the right level. You define your own programs with the help of the library functions.

Chapter 3, Types and Classes
This chapter is a bit heavier, and I had to read some things twice. It goes through Types and curried functions and Classes.
The Class concept is a bit hard to grasp. There were lots of new words and terminologies so it was hard for me to understand the text.
I got some things explained by my dad.
These exercises were harder.
