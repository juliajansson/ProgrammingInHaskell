Chapter 1, Introduction
Well explained. Starting right off with the examples, which is a good thing.
The exercises are all managable and on the right level. You already get to define your own functions, with the examples as help.
I made the 17.hs file for this chapter.

Chapter 2, First steps
In this chapter you learn how to use the Hugs compiler. A quick but detailed explanation of the basic rules like function application. 
Some library functions are introduced. You start to see the possibilities. I write a Haskell script, based on the book.
