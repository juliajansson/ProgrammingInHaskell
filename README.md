# ProgrammingInHaskell
My journey through the book [Programming in Haskell](https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/book.html) by Graham Hutton.

I am a 16 year old girl who has just finished my first year of high school in Sweden.
I have a big interest in mathematics. I have wanted to learn programming for a while but it's been hard on my own.
After some Haskell basics from my father and some online tutorials I still felt like a beginner. So I decided to try a real course.
